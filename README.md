An application that taught me the basics of Node which are:

1. How to set up Node on my local machine
2. How to use NPM to download required packages
3. How to set up Express and MongoDB Atlas Clusters
4. How the Node server receives HTTP requests (GET , POST , PUT , DELETE) => CRUD functionality
5. How to render the server's responses to the user interface using the EJS template engine
